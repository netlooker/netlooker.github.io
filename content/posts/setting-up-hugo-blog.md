## My First Experience with a Static Site Generator

As I was searching for the perfect solution to host my personal blog website, I found myself faced with a tough decision: should I go with the popular choice of WordPress or try something new with a static site generator?
After weighing the pros and cons of both options, I decided to take a leap and try out a static site generator. And that's when I discovered the [**Hugo Static Site Generator**](https://gohugo.io) - a project that immediately caught my attention and sparked my curiosity. With excitement and a bit of apprehension, I dive in and begin to explore all that this innovative tool has to offer.
